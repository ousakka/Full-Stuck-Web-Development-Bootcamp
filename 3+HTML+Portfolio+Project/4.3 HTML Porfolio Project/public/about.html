<h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Hi, I'm Oumaima! I originally studied Automation Engineering and graduated in June 2024 in Tunisia. In July 2024, I moved to Denmark to start a new chapter in my life, both personally and professionally. While I enjoyed engineering, I realized I wanted something more dynamic and creative in my career. That’s when I decided to explore web development.</p>
<p>With my background in automation, I already have a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving, which makes this transition exciting rather than overwhelming. I love the idea of building things from scratch, solving challenges, and creating digital experiences that people can actually use. Web development feels like the perfect blend of logic and creativity, and I’m eager to keep learning, improving, and eventually contributing to real-world projects.</p>
<p>This journey is just beginning, but I’m excited about the possibilities ahead. Every day, I discover something new, and that’s what keeps me motivated!
